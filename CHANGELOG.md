  - `withErrorBoundary` HOC - Higher-order component for easy error boundary wrapping
  - User-friendly error messages with retry functionality
  - Development mode shows detailed error information for debugging
- Complete SEO metadata for all 10 calculator pages (100% coverage):
  - Created layout.tsx files for: Calorie Deficit, Weight Management, Maximum Fat Loss, Conversions
  - All pages now have: title, description, keywords, canonical URLs, OpenGraph tags, Twitter Cards
  - Improves search engine discoverability and social media sharing
  - Coming soon pages optimized for SEO while in development
- Scientific references and documentation for all calculator formulas:
  - BMI calculator: WHO, CDC, historical references
  - TDEE calculator: Mifflin-St Jeor (1990), Harris-Benedict (1984), Katch-McArdle citations
  - Body Fat calculator: U.S. Navy method (1984), BMI method references
  - All formulas now include proper scientific attribution and category documentation

### Changed

- README.md now includes comprehensive "Available Scripts" documentation
- Improved developer experience with clearly documented npm commands
- Layout.tsx updated to include PWAInit component for seamless PWA functionality
- Repository automation now uses Bun-first docs and repo-wide Prettier checks

### Improved

- PWA functionality now works out of the box without manual configuration
- Better user experience with automatic service worker updates
- Cookie consent now loads advertising scripts only after explicit consent

### Fixed

- Resolved failing organization workflows caused by outdated `actions/checkout` pins
- Updated `actions/upload-artifact` pin in CI to match the latest safe Dependabot target

- Prevented duplicate CodeQL uploads by converting the extra org workflow into a no-op status job
- Fixed offline cached-page filtering logic in `public/offline.html`
- Replaced author bio `<img>` elements with `next/image` to satisfy lint rules

### Refactored

- Consolidated duplicate utility functions between `calculators.ts` and `conversions.ts`
  - Eliminated 7 duplicate functions (formatNumber, height/weight converters)
  - `calculators.ts` now re-exports from `conversions.ts` for better code organization
  - Maintained backward compatibility for all existing imports
  - `conversions.ts` is now the single source of truth for unit conversions (better error handling)
