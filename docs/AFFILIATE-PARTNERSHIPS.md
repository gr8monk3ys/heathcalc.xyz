## Likely Affiliate Options (Network-Based)

## Programs Without Clear Public Affiliate Pages

- **MyFitnessPal**: Official help center only shows “invite a friend” flows, not an affiliate program.

## Recommended Next Actions

1. Apply to the three priority programs above and request **trackable links + discount codes**.
2. Once accepted, swap the corresponding `url` values in `src/constants/affiliates.ts`.
3. If MyFitnessPal’s network listing is suitable, apply there; otherwise keep the Amazon/search links until a formal program exists.
