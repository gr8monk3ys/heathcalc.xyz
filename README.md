## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for server-side rendering
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed JavaScript
  - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI library

- **Development Tools:**
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Code linting
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn

### Vercel Preview Domains (Important)

Vercel preview deployments only issue TLS certificates for the base preview host. Do **not** use a
`www.` subdomain on preview URLs or you will see `ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`. Use the base URL
Vercel provides (for example, `https://your-project.vercel.app`) instead.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gr8monk3ys/heathcheck.info.git
   cd heathcheck.info
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

To start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

## Available Scripts

In addition to the standard Next.js scripts, this project includes several helpful commands:

### Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` - Build production-ready application
- `npm run start` - Start production server

### Code Quality

- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check for code issues
- `npm run lint:fix` - Automatically fix ESLint errors where possible
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check if code is properly formatted
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors
- `npm run validate` - Run all checks (format, lint, type-check) - **recommended before commits**

### Maintenance

- `npm run clean` - Remove build artifacts (.next, out, cache)
- `npm run audit:fix` - Automatically fix security vulnerabilities
- `npm run update` - Update caniuse-lite and browserslist databases

### Recommended Workflow

Before committing changes:

```bash
npm run validate  # Ensures code passes all checks
```
