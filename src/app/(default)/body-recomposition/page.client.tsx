    question: 'What is body recomposition and how does it work?',
    answer:
      'Body recomposition (recomp) is the process of losing fat while simultaneously building muscle, rather than focusing on weight loss alone. It works by strategically managing calories and macros through calorie cycling: eating at a slight surplus on training days to fuel muscle growth, and a deficit on rest days to promote fat loss. This approach requires progressive resistance training 3-5x/week, high protein intake (1g per lb bodyweight), and patience - visible results typically take 8-12 weeks. Recomp is most effective for beginners with higher body fat (15-25%), who have greater potential for muscle growth and fat loss. The key is consistency with training and nutrition while maintaining a small calorie balance that averages near maintenance over the week.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who should do body recomposition vs traditional bulking/cutting?',
    answer:
      'Body recomposition is ideal for: beginners (less than 1 year training) who can gain muscle easily, individuals at moderate body fat (15-25% for men, 23-35% for women) looking to improve body composition without dramatic weight changes, people who want sustainable lifestyle changes rather than aggressive diets, and those returning after training breaks. Traditional bulk/cut cycles work better for: advanced lifters who have maximized beginner gains, very lean individuals (under 12% BF men, 20% women) needing a surplus to build muscle, competitive bodybuilders with specific stage deadlines, and people comfortable with weight fluctuations. Recomp requires more precise tracking and patience but produces more sustainable results. If you are over 25% body fat (men) or 35% (women), consider focusing on fat loss first before recomping.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does calorie cycling work for body recomposition?',
    answer:
      'Calorie cycling alternates between higher calories on training days and lower calories on rest days to simultaneously support muscle growth and fat loss. On training days (typically 4 days/week), eat 10-15% above maintenance to fuel performance, maximize muscle protein synthesis, and support recovery. On rest days (3 days/week), eat 15-20% below maintenance to create a fat loss deficit while preserving muscle. This creates a small weekly calorie deficit or balance that promotes fat loss without sacrificing muscle gains. Pair this with high protein (1g per lb bodyweight) at every meal, 25% calories from healthy fats for hormones, and carbs primarily around training for energy. The cycling approach works because muscle building happens during and after training (24-48 hours), while fat loss can occur on rest days when energy demands are lower.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much protein do I need for body recomposition?',
    answer:
      'For body recomposition, aim for 1g protein per pound of bodyweight (or 2.2g per kg) daily, which is higher than typical recommendations. This amount maximizes muscle protein synthesis while preventing muscle breakdown during the calorie deficit on rest days. Distribute protein across 3-5 meals with 25-40g per meal for optimal absorption. High protein also increases satiety (helps you feel full), has a higher thermic effect (burns more calories during digestion at 20-30% vs 5-10% for carbs/fats), and preserves lean mass during fat loss. Protein sources: lean meats, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, protein powder. If you are over 30% body fat, calculate protein based on target body weight rather than current weight to avoid excessive protein intake. Most research shows no harm from high protein in healthy individuals, but stay hydrated.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What training program should I follow for body recomposition?',
    answer:
      'For optimal body recomposition, follow a progressive resistance training program 3-5x/week focused on compound movements: squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows, and pull-ups. These exercises recruit the most muscle mass and create the greatest stimulus for growth. Train each muscle group 2-3x per week with 3-4 sets of 6-12 reps per exercise, progressively increasing weight or reps each week. Beginners: 3-4 days, full-body or upper/lower split. Intermediate: 4-5 days, push/pull/legs or upper/lower split. Advanced: 4-6 days, PPL or body part split. Add 2-3 HIIT cardio sessions on rest days if cutting aggressively. Prioritize strength gains - if you are getting stronger, you are building muscle. Rest 48 hours between training the same muscle group. Track workouts to ensure progressive overload, which is the key driver of muscle growth.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does body recomposition take to see results?',
    answer:
      'Visible body recomposition results typically take 8-16 weeks, though individual timelines vary significantly. Week 1-4: strength increases, better gym performance, clothing fits differently (often muscle swelling). Week 4-8: visible fat loss in waist/hips, muscle definition emerging, scale weight may stay similar. Week 8-12: noticeable muscle growth, clear reduction in body fat, friends comment on physique changes. Week 12-16: significant body composition improvements, potentially 5-10 lbs fat lost and 3-6 lbs muscle gained (beginners). Progress depends on: training experience (beginners see faster changes), current body fat (higher BF loses fat faster), consistency with diet and training, sleep and stress management (7-9 hours sleep crucial), and genetics (some respond faster). Track progress with photos, measurements (waist, chest, arms, thighs), and strength gains rather than just scale weight. Recomp shows better in measurements and appearance than weight alone.',
