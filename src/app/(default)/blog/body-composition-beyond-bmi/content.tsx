          for this site, and I think BMI is one of the least useful health metrics a person can
          track. That&apos;s not a contradiction. BMI is widespread, people search for it, and it
          gives you a number you can use as a rough screening tool. But the moment you start
          treating it as a meaningful indicator of individual health, you&apos;ve gone wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let me explain why, what to measure instead, and how to actually understand your body
          composition in a way that tells you something useful.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          The Accidental History of BMI
        </h2>

        <p>
          BMI was not created by a doctor. It was created by a Belgian astronomer and statistician
          named Adolphe Quetelet in the 1830s. Quetelet was interested in defining &quot;the average
          man&quot; as a statistical concept. He noticed that body weight scaled roughly with the
          square of height across populations, and he described this mathematical relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
          That was it. He was not trying to create a health metric. He was not studying disease or
          fitness or body fat. He was doing population-level statistics with the tools available in
          1835.
        </p>

        <p>
          The formula sat mostly unused for over a century until Ancel Keys published a paper in
          1972 that dubbed it the &quot;Body Mass Index&quot; and argued it was useful for
          epidemiological studies. Keys himself was explicit that BMI was meant for population
          research, not individual diagnosis. He wrote that it was &quot;not fully
          satisfactory&quot; and acknowledged its limitations.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the insurance industry and public health agencies wanted something simple. BMI was
          simple. You could calculate it with a bathroom scale and a tape measure. No blood tests,
          no scans, no expertise needed. By the 1990s, it had become the primary screening tool for
          overweight and obesity classifications worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>That decision had consequences we are still dealing with.</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          Where BMI Fails: The Obvious Cases
        </h2>

        <p>
          The most commonly cited failure of BMI is with athletes. Dwayne Johnson has a BMI of
          roughly 34, which classifies him as &quot;obese.&quot; Most NFL running backs are
          &quot;overweight&quot; or &quot;obese&quot; by BMI. Competitive CrossFit athletes,
          gymnasts, and sprinters routinely fall outside the &quot;normal&quot; range.
        </p>

        <p>
          This happens because BMI treats all weight as equal. It divides weight by height squared.
          It cannot distinguish between 200 pounds of muscle and 200 pounds of fat. For anyone who
          has built significant muscle mass, BMI will overestimate health risk.
        </p>

        <p>But athletes are the obvious example. The less obvious failures are more concerning.</p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          The Elderly
        </h3>

        <p>
          Older adults lose muscle mass as they age (a process called sarcopenia). A 75-year-old
          with a BMI of 23 might have significantly more body fat than a 30-year-old with the same
          BMI, because the older person has lost muscle and replaced it with fat. The number looks
          the same. The body composition is completely different.
        </p>

        <p>
          Multiple studies, including a 2014 analysis in the Annals of Internal Medicine, have shown
          that the &quot;optimal&quot; BMI for mortality risk shifts higher with age. Elderly adults
          with BMIs of 25 to 30 (classified as &quot;overweight&quot;) actually have lower mortality
          rates than those with &quot;normal&quot; BMIs. This is sometimes called the obesity
          paradox, and it probably reflects the fact that some of that extra weight is protective
          muscle mass or metabolic reserve.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          Different Ethnicities
        </h3>

        <p>
          BMI cutoffs were established primarily from data on white European populations. They do
          not translate cleanly across ethnic groups.
        </p>

        <p>
          People of South Asian descent tend to carry more visceral fat at lower BMIs. A BMI of 23
          in a South Asian individual may carry similar metabolic risk to a BMI of 25 to 27 in a
          white European. The WHO acknowledged this in 2004 by suggesting lower BMI cutoffs for
          Asian populations, but many health systems still use the universal thresholds.
        </p>

        <p>
          People of Polynesian and Pacific Islander descent tend to have greater bone density and
          lean mass, meaning BMI overestimates their fat mass and health risk. Black Americans also
          tend to have higher bone mineral density and lean mass compared to white Americans at the
          same BMI.
        </p>

        <p>
          A single set of BMI cutoffs applied across all populations is, to be direct,
          scientifically lazy. The data has been clear on this for decades.

          Normal Weight Obesity: The Hidden Risk
        </h2>

        <p>
          This is where BMI&apos;s failures become genuinely dangerous. &quot;Normal weight
          obesity&quot; describes people who have a BMI in the normal range (18.5 to 24.9) but carry
          an unhealthy amount of body fat.
        </p>

        <p>
          A 2008 study by Romero-Corral et al. in the European Heart Journal examined over 6,000
          adults and found that roughly 30% of people with normal BMIs had body fat percentages that
          met the criteria for obesity. These individuals had higher rates of metabolic syndrome,
          dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular risk factors compared to their normal-weight,
          normal-body-fat counterparts.
        </p>

        <p>
          A follow-up analysis using NHANES data (De Lorenzo et al., 2013) found that normal weight
          obese women had cardiovascular risk profiles similar to women classified as obese by BMI.
          Their BMI said &quot;healthy.&quot; Their body composition said otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          This matters because these people fall through the screening cracks. Their doctor checks
          BMI, sees a normal number, and moves on. No one investigates further. The patient feels
          fine because the metric says they&apos;re fine. Meanwhile, their visceral fat is
          accumulating around their organs, driving inflammation and insulin resistance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think this is the strongest argument against relying on BMI alone. It&apos;s not just
          inaccurate for athletes. It misses people who are genuinely at risk.

          Body Fat Percentage: What Actually Matters
        </h2>

        <p>
          If BMI is a blunt instrument, body fat percentage is a much sharper one. It tells you what
          proportion of your total body weight is fat versus everything else (muscle, bone, water,
          organs).

        <p>
          Women carry more essential fat than men due to hormonal and reproductive demands. This is
          not a flaw. It is biology. A woman at 20% body fat is roughly equivalent in leanness to a
          man at 12%.
        </p>

        <p>
          The challenge with body fat percentage is measurement. Unlike BMI, you cannot calculate it
          with simple math. You need an actual measurement method, and every method has trade-offs.
        </p>

          Measuring Body Fat: Methods Compared
        </h2>

        <p>I&apos;ve organized these from most to least accurate, with practical notes on each.</p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          DEXA Scan (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)
        </h3>

        <p>
          DEXA is the clinical gold standard. It uses low-dose X-rays to differentiate between bone,
          lean tissue, and fat tissue. It gives you total body fat percentage, regional fat
          distribution, and bone density.
        </p>

        <p>
          Accuracy is within 1-2% body fat. The downside: it costs $75 to $200 per scan, it requires
          a clinic visit, and results can vary between machines and technicians. A 2019 review in
          Clinical Nutrition found that even DEXA results can differ by 1-3% between devices from
          different manufacturers. Still, for a one-time baseline measurement, it is the best option
          available outside of a research lab.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          Hydrostatic Weighing
        </h3>

        <p>
          You get dunked in a tank of water. Your underwater weight is compared to your dry weight,
          and the difference is used to calculate body density, which is then converted to body fat
          percentage. Accuracy is comparable to DEXA (within 1-2.5%).
        </p>

        <p>
          It&apos;s uncomfortable, requires you to fully exhale while submerged, and is only
          available at universities and specialized facilities. Not practical for regular tracking.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          Navy Method (Circumference-Based)
        </h3>

        <p>
          The U.S. Navy method uses neck, waist, and hip circumferences (plus height) to estimate
          body fat. Our{' '}
          <Link href="/body-fat" className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">
            body fat calculator
          </Link>{' '}
          includes this method.
        </p>

        <p>
          Accuracy is within 3-4% of DEXA for most people. It&apos;s free, requires only a tape
          measure, and is reasonably repeatable if you measure consistently. The main weakness is
          that it assumes fat distribution follows a standard pattern. If you carry fat differently
          than the average Navy recruit from the 1980s, it may be less accurate for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          For regular at-home tracking, I think this is the best option. Not because it&apos;s the
          most accurate, but because you can do it weekly with consistent conditions and track
          trends over time. The trend matters more than the absolute number.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)
        </h3>

        <p>
          This is what smart scales and handheld body fat devices use. A small electrical current
          passes through your body. Since muscle conducts electricity better than fat, the
          resistance (impedance) is used to estimate body composition.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem: BIA is wildly affected by hydration. If you&apos;re dehydrated, it
          overestimates body fat. If you just drank a liter of water, it underestimates. Time of
          day, recent meals, recent exercise, and even skin temperature all influence the reading.
          Error margins of 5-8% are common, which makes a single reading nearly meaningless.
        </p>

        <p>
          High-end medical-grade BIA devices (like InBody) perform better, with error margins closer
          to 3%. But the consumer-grade scale you bought on Amazon? Take its body fat reading with a
          large amount of skepticism.
        </p>

          Skinfold Calipers
        </h3>

        <p>
          A trained person pinches folds of skin at specific body sites and measures their thickness
          with calipers. The measurements are plugged into equations to estimate total body fat.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the hands of an experienced technician, accuracy is within 3-4%. In your own hands,
          with no training, accuracy drops significantly. The technique matters enormously. Which
          site you pinch, how hard you pinch, and where exactly you place the calipers all affect
          the result.

          Better Metrics: Waist-to-Hip Ratio and ABSI
        </h2>

        <p>
          If body fat percentage is hard to measure accurately at home, are there simpler metrics
          that still tell you something useful about health risk? Yes.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR)
        </h3>

        <p>
          WHR is exactly what it sounds like: waist circumference divided by hip circumference. It
          captures how your fat is distributed, which turns out to be more important for health
          outcomes than how much fat you have overall.
        </p>

        <p>
          A 2011 meta-analysis published in the International Journal of Epidemiology (Czernichow et
          al.) analyzed data from over 220,000 participants and found that WHR was a stronger
          predictor of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality than BMI. People with high WHR
          (indicating more fat around the midsection) had significantly higher risks regardless of
          their BMI classification.
        </p>

        <p>
          The World Health Organization considers abdominal obesity to exist when WHR exceeds 0.90
          for men or 0.85 for women. You can calculate yours with our{' '}

          A Body Shape Index (ABSI)
        </h3>

        <p>
          ABSI, developed by Krakauer and Krakauer (2012), goes a step further. It adjusts waist
          circumference for BMI and height, effectively isolating the health impact of abdominal fat
          distribution from overall body size.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their research, published in PLOS ONE, showed that ABSI predicted mortality risk
          independently of BMI. Someone with a high ABSI (lots of abdominal fat relative to their
          overall size) had a significantly higher death risk than someone with a low ABSI, even if
          both had the same BMI. A 2015 follow-up study confirmed the finding across multiple
          populations.

          gives you this metric. Combined with WHR and body fat percentage, you get a substantially
          more complete picture than BMI alone can provide.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          Waist-to-Height Ratio
        </h3>

        <p>
          The simplest and possibly most powerful single metric. Just divide your waist
          circumference by your height. If the result is over 0.5, you are carrying excess abdominal
          fat.
        </p>

        <p>
          A 2012 systematic review in Obesity Reviews (Ashwell et al.) analyzed 31 studies and
          concluded that waist-to-height ratio was a better discriminator of health outcomes
          (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality) than both BMI and waist
          circumference alone. The 0.5 cutoff worked across ages, sexes, and ethnicities. You can

          What the Research Says About Body Fat and Health Outcomes
        </h2>

        <p>
          The relationship between body fat and health is not a straight line. You do not become
          progressively healthier as you get leaner. There is a U-shaped curve, where both too much
          and too little body fat increase health risks.
        </p>

        <p>
          For men, body fat below 5% is associated with hormonal disruption, immune suppression, and
          reduced cognitive function. Competitive bodybuilders who reach 3-5% for a show often
          report fatigue, mood disturbances, and loss of sex drive. This is not a sustainable or
          healthy state.
        </p>

        <p>
          For women, body fat below 12-14% often disrupts menstrual function. The female athlete
          triad (now called Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, or RED-S) involves low energy
          availability, menstrual dysfunction, and decreased bone density. It is a serious medical
          condition, not a badge of fitness.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other end, the health risks of excess body fat are well established: increased risk
          of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, sleep apnea, and joint
          problems. But the exact threshold where risk increases meaningfully is debated and varies
          by individual.
        </p>

        <p>
          A 2016 analysis in JAMA Internal Medicine using data from the National Health and
          Nutrition Examination Survey found that the lowest mortality risk for men was in the
          14-20% body fat range, and for women in the 20-28% range. Going below those ranges did not
          provide additional health benefits in the general population, and in some subgroups, it
          increased risk.

          A Practical Approach to Body Composition Assessment
        </h2>

        <p>
          Given everything above, here is what I actually recommend for someone who wants to
          understand their body composition without spending hundreds on clinical testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Track waist circumference.</strong> Measure at the narrowest point of your natural
          waist (usually around the navel), first thing in the morning, before eating. This single
          measurement, tracked weekly, tells you more about health-relevant fat changes than body
          weight alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Calculate waist-to-height ratio.</strong> If it&apos;s under 0.5, your abdominal
          fat is likely in a healthy range. If it&apos;s above 0.5, focus on reducing it through
          calorie management and exercise.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Use the Navy method for body fat estimation.</strong> Measure neck, waist, and
          hips consistently, at the same time of day, once a week. Don&apos;t obsess over the
          absolute number. Watch the trend.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Check your WHR and ABSI.</strong> These give you information about fat
          distribution that body fat percentage alone does not capture. Someone with 20% body fat
          concentrated around the midsection has a different risk profile than someone with 20% body
          fat distributed more evenly.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Get a DEXA scan once per year if you can afford it.</strong> This gives you a
          precise baseline and shows you exactly where your fat and lean mass are distributed.
          Compare it to your Navy method estimates to calibrate your at-home measurements.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Stop obsessing over BMI.</strong> Know it. Check it. Then move on to measurements
          that actually matter for your health. BMI is a screening tool for populations. It was
          never designed to describe you as an individual, and it doesn&apos;t do that job well.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
          The Bottom Line
        </h2>

        <p>
          Your body composition is more than a single number. BMI is a quick and easy metric, but it
          cannot distinguish fat from muscle, it fails across ethnicities and age groups, and it
          misses the &quot;normal weight obese&quot; population entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Body fat percentage, waist-to-hip ratio, ABSI, and waist-to-height ratio each capture
          different aspects of health risk. None of them is perfect alone. Together, they give you a
          picture that is genuinely useful.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you only have 30 seconds, measure your waist and divide by your height. If it&apos;s
          under 0.5, you&apos;re probably in a good place. If it&apos;s over 0.5, you have a
          concrete target to work toward.
