        <ul className="space-y-2">
          <li>
            Ozempic and Wegovy contain the exact same molecule (semaglutide) at different doses.
            Mounjaro contains a different molecule (tirzepatide) that hits two receptors instead of
            one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Head-to-head, tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) produces roughly 5-7 percentage points
            more weight loss than semaglutide (Wegovy/Ozempic) at maximal doses
          </li>
          <li>
            Ozempic is FDA-approved only for type 2 diabetes. Using it for weight loss is off-label,
            which matters for insurance coverage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monthly costs range from $935 to $1,350 at list price. Insurance coverage varies
            enormously by plan, indication, and employer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compounded versions are cheaper but exist in a legal gray area that is shifting as FDA
            shortage designations change

        </ul>

      <p>
        The question I get most often about GLP-1 medications is some version of "which one is
        best?" The honest answer is that it depends on your specific situation. But that does not
        mean all three options are equally good for all people. The differences are real and
        measurable, and they matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        This comparison is based on clinical trial data, FDA labeling, and the current (as of early
        2026) pricing and coverage landscape. I will be specific about what the data shows and where
        the data has gaps.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">What Each Drug Actually Is</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        Ozempic and Wegovy: Same Drug, Different Labels
      </h3>

      <p>
        This is the most common point of confusion. Ozempic and Wegovy both contain semaglutide,
        manufactured by Novo Nordisk. They are the same molecule injected subcutaneously once per
        week.
      </p>

      <p>The differences are dosing and FDA-approved indication.</p>

      <p>
        Ozempic is approved for type 2 diabetes management. Its maximum dose is 2.0 mg per week (a
        1.0 mg dose is also available). Wegovy is approved for chronic weight management. Its target
        maintenance dose is 2.4 mg per week, which is 20% higher than Ozempic&apos;s maximum.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, many doctors prescribe Ozempic off-label for weight loss. Sometimes this is
        because it is easier to get covered by insurance (diabetes medications generally have better
        coverage than weight loss medications). Sometimes it is because Wegovy has been in and out
        of shortage since its launch.
      </p>

      <p>
        The practical consequence: someone taking Ozempic at 1.0 mg for weight loss is getting less
        than half the weight-loss dose studied in the STEP trials. They will still lose some weight,
        but likely less than someone on Wegovy 2.4 mg. If you are using Ozempic for weight loss and
        have plateaued, the dose difference may be part of the reason.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">
        Mounjaro and Zepbound: A Different Molecule Entirely
      </h3>

      <p>
        Mounjaro and Zepbound both contain tirzepatide, manufactured by Eli Lilly. Like the
        Ozempic/Wegovy split, these are the same molecule with different approved indications.
        Mounjaro is approved for type 2 diabetes. Zepbound is approved for chronic weight
        management.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tirzepatide is fundamentally different from semaglutide. Where semaglutide is a GLP-1
        receptor agonist only, tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist. It activates both
        the GLP-1 pathway (appetite reduction, slowed gastric emptying, insulin secretion) and the
        GIP pathway (additional effects on appetite, fat metabolism, and insulin sensitivity).
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether that dual mechanism explains the superior weight loss results or whether tirzepatide
        just happens to be a more potent molecule is still debated. The practical result, however,
        is clear: tirzepatide produces more weight loss in clinical trials.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Head-to-Head Efficacy: What the Data Shows</h2>

      <p>
        We do not have a direct randomized trial comparing Wegovy 2.4 mg against Zepbound 15 mg in a
        weight loss population. That is the comparison everyone wants, and it does not exist yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        What we do have is the SURPASS-2 trial (published in the NEJM in 2021), which compared
        tirzepatide against semaglutide 1.0 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is not a
        perfect comparison because the semaglutide dose was 1.0 mg (the diabetes dose, not the 2.4
        mg weight loss dose), but it is the closest head-to-head data available.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 40 weeks, tirzepatide 15 mg produced 12.4 kg of weight loss versus 6.2 kg with
        semaglutide 1.0 mg. Tirzepatide at 10 mg produced 11.2 kg. Even tirzepatide at its lowest
        dose (5 mg) beat semaglutide 1.0 mg: 7.8 kg versus 6.2 kg.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we compare across trials (understanding that cross-trial comparisons have significant
        methodological limitations), the picture looks like this:

      <p>
        The difference is meaningful. At the highest tirzepatide dose, more than half of
        participants lost over 20% of their body weight. With semaglutide, about a third did. For a
        250-pound person, that is the difference between losing 37 pounds and losing 52 pounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        A caveat worth repeating: these are different trials with different patient populations,
        different sites, and slightly different timeframes. The gold-standard comparison
        (randomized, double-blind, same patients) is being done in the ongoing SURMOUNT-5 trial,
        which directly compares tirzepatide 15 mg against semaglutide 2.4 mg. Initial results
        announced in late 2024 confirmed tirzepatide&apos;s superiority, with a roughly 5 percentage
        point greater weight loss.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Dosing Schedules Compared</h2>

      <p>
        All three medications are weekly subcutaneous injections. But their titration schedules
        differ, and this matters because the ramp-up period determines how long it takes to reach a
        therapeutic dose and how much time you spend dealing with dose-escalation side effects.

      <p>
        A few practical notes. The Wegovy and Mounjaro/Zepbound titration schedules are designed to
        be followed as written. Each step gives your body time to adapt before increasing the dose.
        Rushing this process leads to worse side effects without meaningfully faster weight loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ozempic&apos;s titration is somewhat more flexible because it is a diabetes drug where
        dosing is titrated based on blood sugar response, not weight loss. Many people on Ozempic
        for weight loss stay at 1.0 mg and never go to 2.0 mg, which means they are getting less
        than half the dose that was studied for weight loss in the STEP trials.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not everyone needs the maximum dose. Some people achieve excellent results at lower doses
        with fewer side effects. Discuss with your prescriber whether the maximum dose is right for
        you.

      <p>
        A few things that complicate this picture. Eli Lilly launched LillyDirect in early 2024,
        allowing patients to buy single-dose vials of tirzepatide at $549/month directly from the
        company (bypassing pharmacies and insurance entirely). This changed the pricing conversation
        significantly for tirzepatide.
      </p>

      <p>
        Novo Nordisk has not offered a comparable direct-to-consumer program for semaglutide at
        equivalent savings, though manufacturer savings cards can significantly reduce costs for
        commercially insured patients.
      </p>

      <p>
        Medicare explicitly does not cover weight loss medications. This affects a large population
        of older adults with obesity who would benefit from these drugs. Legislation (the Treat and
        Reduce Obesity Act) has been introduced to change this, but as of early 2026, it has not
        passed.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Insurance Coverage: The Obstacle Course</h2>

      <p>
        Getting insurance to cover a GLP-1 medication for weight loss is often a multi-step process.
        Here is what it typically involves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 1: Prior authorization. Almost every insurer requires your doctor to submit
        documentation showing you meet certain criteria, typically a BMI threshold, evidence of
        weight-related conditions, and documentation of failed lifestyle interventions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 2: Formulary check. Your specific plan may cover Wegovy but not Zepbound, or vice
        versa. Some plans cover neither for weight loss but cover Ozempic or Mounjaro for diabetes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 3: Step therapy. Some insurers require you to try and fail a less expensive medication
        first (like phentermine or naltrexone-bupropion) before they will approve a GLP-1.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 4: Ongoing documentation. Many insurers require periodic re-authorization, sometimes
        every 6 or 12 months, with evidence that the medication is working (usually defined as a 5%
        weight loss threshold).
      </p>

      <p>
        The reality is that a significant number of people who would benefit from these medications
        cannot access them because of cost and coverage barriers. If your insurance denies coverage,
        ask your doctor about the appeals process. First-level denials are often overturned on
        appeal.

        Compounded GLP-1 Medications: The Gray Market
      </h2>

      <p>
        Compounding pharmacies have become a major part of the GLP-1 story, and this deserves a
        frank discussion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, compounding pharmacies can produce copies of
        FDA-approved drugs when those drugs are listed on the FDA Drug Shortage List. Semaglutide
        was on the shortage list from March 2022 through early 2024. During that period, compounding
        pharmacies legally produced and sold semaglutide at a fraction of the brand-name price.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is where it gets complicated. As Novo Nordisk ramped up production and the FDA shortage
        designation was resolved, the legal basis for compounding semaglutide began to erode. Novo
        Nordisk filed lawsuits and the FDA issued guidance restricting compounding of semaglutide.
        Some compounding pharmacies have continued to operate in legal gray areas, arguing various
        exemptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tirzepatide went through a similar cycle: shortage designation, legal compounding, then
        resolution of shortage and legal challenges.
      </p>

      <p>If you are considering a compounded version, here is what you should know.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Quality is variable.</strong> Brand-name drugs undergo rigorous FDA manufacturing
        oversight. Compounding pharmacies are regulated by state boards of pharmacy, with varying
        levels of oversight. Testing by independent labs has found that some compounded semaglutide
        products contain less active ingredient than labeled, and some have contained impurities.
        Others have tested accurately. You are relying on the specific pharmacy&apos;s quality
        control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Legal status is uncertain.</strong> What is legal today may not be tomorrow. Several
        compounding pharmacies have received cease-and-desist letters. If you are on a compounded
        version and the pharmacy is forced to stop producing it, you need a backup plan.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Dosing may differ.</strong> Compounded versions may come in vials that require you
        to draw up your own injection, rather than pre-filled pens. This introduces the possibility
        of dosing errors. Make sure you are comfortable with the injection process and have been
        properly trained.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am not going to tell you whether compounded GLP-1s are right for you. I do think the
        financial reality of brand-name pricing makes compounded versions the only option for many
        people. Just go in with your eyes open about the trade-offs.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Side Effect Comparison</h2>

      <p>
        GI side effects are common with all GLP-1 medications, but the rates differ enough to be
        worth comparing.

      <p>
        The pattern is consistent: tirzepatide has lower GI side effect rates across the board,
        despite producing more weight loss. The vomiting difference is particularly notable (25% vs
        12%). If GI tolerance is a primary concern for you, tirzepatide may be better tolerated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Discontinuation rates due to adverse events are similar between the two drugs (roughly
        6-7%), suggesting that while semaglutide causes more GI symptoms, the severity is manageable
        for most people.

            <p>
              Tirzepatide (Zepbound or Mounjaro) produces the most weight loss in clinical trials,
              with lower GI side effect rates. If insurance covers it or you can manage the cost, it
              is the strongest option based on current data.

            <p>
              Both Mounjaro and Ozempic are FDA-approved for diabetes and produce significant weight
              loss. Mounjaro produces more weight loss and better A1c reduction in head-to-head data
              (SURPASS-2). Insurance coverage for the diabetes indication is typically better than
              for weight loss.

          <div>
            <p className="font-semibold">If cardiovascular risk reduction is important:</p>
            <p>
              Semaglutide (Wegovy) has the strongest cardiovascular outcomes data, with the SELECT
              trial showing a 20% reduction in MACE events. Tirzepatide cardiovascular outcomes data
              (SURPASS-CVOT) is expected but not yet published.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p className="font-semibold">If cost is the primary barrier:</p>
            <p>
              LillyDirect offers tirzepatide at $549/month (no insurance needed). Compounded
              semaglutide, where legally available, can run $200-500/month. Some patients get
              Ozempic covered through diabetes insurance pathways even when their primary goal is
              weight loss.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p className="font-semibold">If you are very sensitive to GI side effects:</p>
            <p>
              Tirzepatide has consistently lower nausea and vomiting rates. Starting at the lowest
              dose (2.5 mg) and titrating slowly over 20+ weeks may also help. Slower titration of
              semaglutide is another option.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">What About Oral Semaglutide?</h2>

      <p>
        Rybelsus is an oral formulation of semaglutide, currently approved only for type 2 diabetes
        at doses up to 14 mg daily. It is taken as a pill rather than an injection, which some
        people prefer.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, oral semaglutide at the 14 mg dose produces significantly less weight loss than the
        injectable 2.4 mg dose. Oral bioavailability of semaglutide is only about 1%, meaning most
        of the pill is destroyed in the GI tract before it gets absorbed. You need a much larger
        dose orally to achieve the same blood levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        Novo Nordisk is developing a higher-dose oral semaglutide (25 mg and 50 mg) specifically for
        weight loss. Phase 3 trials (the OASIS program) showed the 50 mg oral dose produced about
        15.1% weight loss at 68 weeks, which is comparable to injectable Wegovy 2.4 mg. An FDA
        application has been submitted, with potential approval in 2026.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you hate needles, this might eventually be your best option. But it is not available for
        weight loss yet.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The Next Generation: What Is Coming</h2>

      <p>
        The GLP-1 medication landscape is evolving fast. Several next-generation drugs are in
        late-stage development.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Retatrutide</strong> (Eli Lilly) is a triple agonist hitting GLP-1, GIP, and
        glucagon receptors. Phase 2 data published in the NEJM in 2023 showed up to 24.2% weight
        loss at 48 weeks. Phase 3 trials are ongoing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Orforglipron</strong> (Eli Lilly) is a non-peptide oral GLP-1 agonist. Unlike
        Rybelsus (which is a peptide squeezed into a pill), orforglipron is a small molecule with
        much better oral bioavailability. Phase 2 data showed up to 14.7% weight loss at 36 weeks.
        Phase 3 trials are underway.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>CagriSema</strong> (Novo Nordisk) combines semaglutide with cagrilintide (an amylin
        analog). The REDEFINE program is testing this combination, with early data suggesting weight
        loss potentially exceeding individual components.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trajectory is clear: more effective drugs, more delivery options (oral, higher doses),
        and eventually lower costs as competition increases. But for now, semaglutide and
        tirzepatide are the options on the table.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Making Your Decision</h2>

      <p>
        There is no substitute for a conversation with your doctor who knows your medical history,
        your insurance situation, and your goals. What I can tell you from the data is this:
        tirzepatide produces more weight loss with fewer GI side effects. Semaglutide has stronger
        cardiovascular outcomes data. Both work. Neither is cheap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whatever medication you choose, the fundamentals do not change. Eat enough protein (our{' '}

        can help you figure out exactly how much). Do resistance training. Stay hydrated. Titrate
        slowly. Track your progress beyond just the scale.
      </p>

      <p>The medication is a tool. A powerful one. What you build with it is up to you.</p>
