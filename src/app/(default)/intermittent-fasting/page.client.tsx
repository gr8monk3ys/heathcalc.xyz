    question: 'What is the best intermittent fasting schedule for beginners?',
    answer:
      'The 16:8 method is the most beginner-friendly intermittent fasting protocol. You fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window, typically skipping breakfast and eating from noon to 8 PM. This schedule is easy to maintain, fits most lifestyles, and provides significant benefits without being too restrictive. Most people find it sustainable long-term and can gradually extend to 18:6 if desired.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I drink coffee during my fasting window?',
    answer:
      'Yes, black coffee is allowed during fasting windows and can actually help suppress appetite. Coffee contains virtually no calories and does not significantly impact insulin levels. However, avoid adding milk, cream, sugar, or any caloric sweeteners, as these break your fast. Unsweetened tea, water, and sparkling water are also excellent choices during fasting periods.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will intermittent fasting slow down my metabolism?',
    answer:
      'No, intermittent fasting does not slow down your metabolism when done correctly. Short-term fasting (16-24 hours) actually increases metabolic rate slightly by boosting norepinephrine levels. The key is ensuring you eat enough calories during your eating window to meet your daily needs. Chronic severe calorie restriction can slow metabolism, but IF with adequate calorie intake supports metabolic health.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to see results from intermittent fasting?',
    answer:
      'Most people notice initial benefits within 2-4 weeks, including increased energy, mental clarity, and reduced bloating. Weight loss results typically become visible after 4-6 weeks of consistent fasting. The adaptation period takes 1-2 weeks as your body adjusts to using fat for fuel. Long-term metabolic benefits, improved insulin sensitivity, and autophagy effects develop over 3-6 months of consistent practice.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I do intermittent fasting on workout days?',
    answer:
      'Yes, you can exercise during intermittent fasting, but timing matters. For best results, schedule resistance training toward the end of your fasting window or at the start of your eating window, then eat protein-rich meals afterward. Fasted cardio is fine for most people. If you experience weakness or dizziness during workouts, consider breaking your fast earlier on training days or having a small pre-workout meal.',

              Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting
              and eating. Rather than focusing on what you eat, IF emphasizes when you eat. This
              approach has gained popularity due to its potential benefits for weight loss,
              metabolic health, and longevity.
