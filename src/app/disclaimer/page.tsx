        <p className="mb-4">
          The information provided on HealthCheck is for general informational and educational purposes only. 
          The calculators, articles, and other content on this website are not intended to be a substitute 
          for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions 
          you may have regarding a medical condition or before starting any diet, exercise, or health-related 
          program.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Calculator Accuracy</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While we strive to provide accurate calculators based on established scientific formulas, all 
          results should be considered estimates. The accuracy of our calculators depends on:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>The accuracy of the information you input</li>
          <li>Individual variations not accounted for in standardized formulas</li>
          <li>The inherent limitations of the calculation methods used</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For example, body fat percentage calculators use formulas that provide estimates based on 
          population averages and may not account for individual variations in body composition. Similarly, 
          calorie and metabolic rate calculators provide approximations that may vary from laboratory 
          measurements.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the most accurate assessment of your health metrics, consult with healthcare professionals 
          who can perform clinical measurements.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Not Medical Advice</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The content on HealthCheck, including calculator results, articles, and recommendations, does not 
          constitute medical advice. We do not diagnose conditions, prescribe treatments, or provide any 
          kind of healthcare services.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our calculators and content are designed to provide general guidance and education about health 
          and fitness topics. They are not personalized to your specific health situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you have 
          read or calculated on our website.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Health and Fitness Risks</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Before starting any diet, weight loss, or exercise program, consult with appropriate healthcare 
          professionals. There are risks associated with any fitness program, especially for people with 
          pre-existing health conditions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Extreme calorie restriction or rapid weight loss can be dangerous and is not recommended. Our 
          calculators may provide information about various calorie deficit levels, but this does not 
          constitute an endorsement of extreme approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend moderate, sustainable approaches to health and fitness, and encourage you to work 
          with healthcare professionals to develop a plan that is safe and appropriate for your individual 
          circumstances.
