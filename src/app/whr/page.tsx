    question: 'What is a healthy waist-to-hip ratio?',
    answer:
      'Healthy WHR varies by gender due to natural body composition differences. For men, WHR < 0.90 is excellent, 0.90-0.99 is good, 1.0+ indicates increased health risk. For women, WHR < 0.80 is excellent, 0.80-0.85 is good, 0.86+ indicates increased health risk. These thresholds are based on extensive research linking WHR to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and mortality. WHR is a simple yet powerful predictor of metabolic health because it reflects visceral fat distribution.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I accurately measure my waist and hips for WHR?',
    answer:
      "For accurate WHR measurements: 1) Waist - Stand upright, locate the narrowest point between your ribs and hip bones (usually at navel level), wrap tape measure around horizontally, breathe normally and measure at the end of exhale. 2) Hips - Measure around the widest part of your buttocks and hips, keeping tape parallel to floor. 3) Use a flexible measuring tape, don't compress skin, take 2-3 measurements and average them. Measure in the morning before eating, wear minimal clothing, and use the same measuring spots each time for consistency.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is WHR more useful than BMI for health assessment?',
    answer:
      'WHR captures fat distribution, which BMI completely ignores. Two people with identical BMI can have vastly different health risks based on where fat is stored. Apple-shaped bodies (high WHR) store more visceral fat around organs, increasing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and inflammation risk. Pear-shaped bodies (low WHR) store more subcutaneous fat in hips/thighs, which is metabolically safer. WHR is independent of overall body size, making it useful across all weight categories. Athletes with high muscle mass may have elevated BMI but excellent WHR.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do men and women have different WHR standards?',
    answer:
      "Yes, biological sex significantly affects WHR norms due to hormonal differences in fat storage. Women naturally store more fat in hips and thighs (gynoid pattern) due to estrogen, resulting in lower WHR (typically 0.70-0.80). Men store more fat around the abdomen (android pattern) due to testosterone patterns, resulting in higher WHR (typically 0.85-0.95). Health risk thresholds reflect these differences: women's risk increases above 0.85, men's above 0.95. These differences exist across all ethnic groups, though specific thresholds may vary slightly by ethnicity.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I reduce my waist-to-hip ratio?',
    answer:
      'Reducing WHR requires reducing abdominal fat while maintaining or building hip/gluteal muscle: 1) Calorie deficit combined with whole foods diet rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats. 2) Cardiovascular exercise to burn overall fat (150+ minutes/week). 3) Resistance training focusing on lower body (squats, lunges, deadlifts) to build glute and hip muscles. 4) Core strengthening exercises. 5) Reduce alcohol, which promotes abdominal fat storage. 6) Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) and stress management to reduce cortisol. You cannot spot-reduce fat, but building hip/glute muscle while losing overall fat will improve WHR.',
