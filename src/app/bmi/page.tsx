  {
    question: 'What is a healthy BMI range?',
    answer:
      "For adults, a healthy BMI typically ranges from 18.5 to 24.9 according to WHO standards. BMI under 18.5 is considered underweight, 25.0-29.9 is overweight, and 30.0 or higher is obese. However, BMI has limitations - it doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat mass, doesn't account for bone density, and may not accurately represent health risks for athletes, elderly individuals, or certain ethnic groups. For children and teens (ages 2-20), BMI is interpreted differently using CDC growth charts and percentiles that account for age and sex.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is BMI accurate for everyone?',
    answer:
      'BMI is a useful screening tool but has significant limitations. It doesn\'t distinguish muscle from fat, so athletes and bodybuilders often have "high" BMI despite low body fat. It may underestimate health risks in older adults who have lost muscle mass. BMI also doesn\'t account for fat distribution - visceral (abdominal) fat poses greater health risks than subcutaneous fat. Ethnicity matters: Asian populations face higher health risks at lower BMI thresholds (≥23 for overweight, ≥27.5 for obesity). For more accurate body composition assessment, consider waist-to-hip ratio, body fat percentage, or waist circumference alongside BMI.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I calculate BMI manually?',
    answer:
      'BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²). For metric: divide your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared. Example: 70 kg ÷ (1.75 m)² = 70 ÷ 3.06 = 22.9 BMI. For imperial: (weight in pounds / height in inches²) × 703. Example: (150 lbs / 65 inches²) × 703 = (150 / 4,225) × 703 = 24.9 BMI. The formula was developed by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet in 1832 and adopted by WHO in the 1980s as a simple population-level health indicator.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I do if my BMI is high?',
    answer:
      "First, consult a healthcare professional to assess your overall health, including waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. BMI alone doesn't diagnose health. If weight loss is recommended: 1) Create a modest calorie deficit (500 kcal/day for 1 lb/week loss), 2) Focus on whole foods, vegetables, lean protein, and fiber, 3) Engage in 150+ minutes of moderate cardio weekly, 4) Add resistance training to preserve muscle mass, 5) Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours) and manage stress. Avoid crash diets or extreme restrictions. Sustainable changes over time are most effective. Even 5-10% weight loss can significantly improve health markers.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Does BMI change with age?',
    answer:
      'Yes, healthy BMI ranges shift with age. Children use age and sex-specific BMI-for-age percentiles (CDC growth charts) rather than adult BMI categories. Muscle mass naturally decreases with age (sarcopenia), while fat mass tends to increase, so older adults may have a "healthy" BMI but unhealthy body composition. Some research suggests slightly higher BMI (25-27) may be protective in older adults (>65 years) - called the "obesity paradox." However, this remains controversial. What\'s most important is maintaining stable weight, preserving muscle mass through resistance training, and monitoring waist circumference as you age.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I have a normal BMI but still be unhealthy?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. This is called "metabolically obese normal weight" (MONW) or "skinny fat." You can have normal BMI (18.5-24.9) but high visceral fat, insulin resistance, high triglycerides, or low muscle mass. Risk factors include sedentary lifestyle, poor diet high in processed foods/sugar, genetics, and chronic stress. MONW individuals have similar cardiovascular disease risks as those with obesity. Key indicators: waist circumference (>40 inches men, >35 inches women), waist-to-hip ratio, body fat percentage, and metabolic markers (blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting glucose). Solution: strength training to build muscle, cardio for heart health, and a nutrient-dense diet rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats.',
