      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
        Waist-to-height ratio compares your waist circumference to your height. It focuses on
        central fat storage, which is often more predictive of health risks than scale weight alone.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600">
        A simple rule of thumb is to keep your waist measurement below half your height. Use this
        calculator as a quick screening tool alongside other metrics like BMI, body fat percentage,
        and blood pressure.
