        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">What is the Body Fat Burn Calculator?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Body Fat Burn Calculator is a tool designed to help you understand how physical activity 
          contributes to weight loss. It calculates the calories burned during specific activities and 
          estimates how long it would take to reach a weight loss goal through exercise alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike general calorie calculators, this tool focuses specifically on the relationship between 
          exercise, energy expenditure, and fat loss, providing a realistic timeline for achieving your goals.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">The Science Behind the Calculator</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This calculator uses several established scientific principles:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Mifflin-St Jeor Formula:</strong> Used to calculate your Resting Energy Expenditure (REE), 
            which is the number of calories your body burns at rest. This formula is considered the most accurate 
            for estimating metabolic rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task):</strong> A measure of the energy cost of physical activities. 
            The calculator uses MET values from the Compendium of Physical Activities, a standardized reference of 
            energy costs for different activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Energy Balance Equation:</strong> The principle that weight loss occurs when energy expenditure 
            exceeds energy intake. The calculator uses the approximation that 3,500 calories equals one pound of fat.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While these principles provide a solid foundation for estimation, individual results may vary based on 
          factors like genetics, body composition, and exercise efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">How to Use the Results</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The calculator provides several key pieces of information:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Energy Expenditure:</strong> Your resting energy expenditure and the calories burned during 
            your selected activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time to Goal:</strong> An estimate of how long it will take to reach your weight loss goal 
            through exercise alone.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exercise Plan:</strong> A summary of your selected activity, duration, and frequency.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          For optimal results, consider these recommendations:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            Use this calculator as one tool in your weight management strategy, not as the sole approach.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine exercise with dietary changes for more effective and sustainable weight loss.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start with realistic goals and gradually increase intensity as your fitness improves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Track your progress and adjust your plan as needed based on real-world results.
