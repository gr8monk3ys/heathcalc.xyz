          A calorie deficit is the foundation of weight loss. By consuming fewer calories than your
          body burns, you force it to use stored energy (primarily fat) for fuel. This calculator
          uses advanced metabolic models to provide realistic projections that account for how your
          body adapts over time.

            <p>
              While the old rule of "3,500 calories equals one pound of fat" is commonly cited,
              modern research shows that weight loss is more complex. Your body adapts to calorie
              restriction in several ways:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <span className="font-medium">Metabolic Adaptation:</span> Your metabolism slows by
                5-15% as you lose weight, making further weight loss more difficult
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="font-medium">Body Composition Changes:</span> You lose both fat and
                some lean mass, affecting your calorie needs
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="font-medium">Hormonal Adjustments:</span> Hunger hormones (ghrelin
                and leptin) change, affecting appetite and energy levels
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="font-medium">Non-Linear Progress:</span> Weight loss isn't
                constant; you'll experience plateaus and fluctuations
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This calculator accounts for metabolic adaptation to provide more realistic estimates
              than simple calorie math.

            <p>
              Healthcare professionals generally recommend minimum calorie intakes to ensure
              adequate nutrition:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">

            <p>
              Going below these thresholds makes it difficult to get adequate vitamins, minerals,

            <p>
              You may notice that your weight loss projections show a slowdown over time. This is
              normal and expected due to:

                <span className="font-medium">Lower body weight:</span> Smaller bodies burn fewer
                calories, so your TDEE decreases as you lose weight

                <span className="font-medium">Metabolic adaptation:</span> Your body becomes more

            <p>
              To continue losing weight, you'll need to either reduce calories further or increase
              physical activity. Most experts recommend recalculating your targets every 5-10 kg
              (10-20 lbs) of weight loss.
