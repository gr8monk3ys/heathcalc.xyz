    <InfoSection title="About A Body Shape Index (ABSI)">
      <p>
        A Body Shape Index (ABSI) is a metric developed in 2012 that combines waist circumference with BMI and height to better predict mortality risk. ABSI focuses on the health risks associated with central obesity (excess abdominal fat).
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-medium mt-4">Why ABSI Matters</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">
        BMI doesn't tell you anything about fat distribution. Two people with the same BMI can have very different body shapes—one might have an "apple-shaped" body (fat concentrated around the waist) while another has a "pear-shaped" body (fat concentrated in the hips and thighs).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Research has shown that abdominal fat (measured by waist circumference) is more strongly linked to health risks than fat in other areas of the body. ABSI was developed to address this limitation of BMI by incorporating waist circumference relative to a person's height and BMI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studies have found that a higher ABSI correlates with increased mortality risk, even in people with normal BMI values. This makes it a valuable complementary measure to traditional body composition metrics.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-medium mt-4">How to Measure Waist Circumference</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">
        It's very important to take an accurate waist measurement for calculating ABSI:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Stand up straight and breathe normally</li>
        <li>Find the top of your hip bones and the bottom of your ribs</li>
        <li>Place the measuring tape midway between these points (usually at the level of your navel)</li>
        <li>Wrap the tape around your waist, keeping it parallel to the floor</li>
        <li>Measure after breathing out normally (don't suck in your stomach)</li>
        <li>Ensure the tape is snug but not digging into your skin</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">
        Use a flexible, non-stretchable measuring tape for the most accurate results.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-medium mt-4">Understanding ABSI Z-Score</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">
        ABSI is typically expressed as a z-score, which compares your value to the average for your age and sex:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li><span className="font-medium">Z-score below -0.868:</span> Very low risk (significantly below average)</li>
        <li><span className="font-medium">Z-score between -0.868 and -0.272:</span> Low risk (below average)</li>
        <li><span className="font-medium">Z-score between -0.272 and 0.229:</span> Average risk</li>
        <li><span className="font-medium">Z-score between 0.229 and 0.798:</span> High risk (above average)</li>
        <li><span className="font-medium">Z-score above 0.798:</span> Very high risk (significantly above average)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-2">
        The further your ABSI z-score is above zero, the higher your predicted health risk. Research has shown that an above-average ABSI is associated with substantially higher risk of premature death.
