        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The maximum fat loss approach is based on scientific research showing that your body has a
          limit to how much fat it can mobilize per day. By respecting this limit, you maximize fat
          loss while preserving muscle mass and metabolic health.

        <Accordion title="The Science Behind Maximum Fat Loss">
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              Research by Dr. Alpert published in the International Journal of Obesity established
              that your body can only mobilize about 22-31 calories per pound of body fat per day.
              This means:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                If your calorie deficit exceeds this limit, you'll likely lose muscle along with fat
              </li>
              <li>
                The more body fat you have, the larger deficit you can sustain without muscle loss
              </li>
              <li>As you lose fat, your maximum sustainable deficit decreases</li>
              <li>This calculator uses a moderate estimate of 26.5 kcal/lb/day for safety</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              For example, someone with 40 pounds of body fat can theoretically mobilize about 1,060
              calories per day from fat stores (40 lbs × 26.5 kcal/lb). A larger deficit would
              likely result in muscle loss.

            <p>
              Protein is THE most important macronutrient during a fat loss phase. This calculator
              recommends 1.6-2.2g per kg of lean body mass based on current research:
